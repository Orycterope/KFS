//! Low-level api to create threads and start them.
//!
//! This module defines the low-level representation of a thread, kind to pthread on Unix.
//! You will want to abstract it in the libstd.
//!
//! # Threads on SunriseOS
//!
//! The sunrise kernel provides only three syscalls of interest relative to threads:
//!
//! * [`svcCreateThread`] : allocates kernel resources for a thread and returns a handle to it.
//! * [`svcStartThread`] : starts a thread created by `svcCreateThread`.
//! * [`svcExitThread`] : terminates the current thread.
//!
//! Note that it is impossible to terminate another thread that our own.
//!
//! The first thread of a process (referred later in this doc as "main thread") gets the handle to
//! its own thread in one of its registers when it is started by the kernel.
//!
//! ### TLS region
//!
//! Every thread possesses a small memory region called [Thread Local Storage region] which the kernel
//! allocates, and puts its address in a ro register so it can be accessed from the userspace.
//!
//! There lives the [IpcBuffer], and a userspace controlled pointer where the user can store a
//! user-defined context. We use it to to keep a pointer to a [ThreadContext] (see below).
//!
//! # Threads in libuser
//!
//! The main thread will always live for the entire life of the process.
//! When its routine returns, it calls `svcExitProcess` and every other thread will be killed.
//!
//! It can create other threads, which are represented by the [`Thread`] struct.
//! A `Thread` detaches (read "leak") the associated thread when it is dropped,
//! which means that there is no longer any handle to thread and no way to join on it.
//!
//! This is analog to the way the libstd threads work.
//!
//! ### Thread context
//!
//! For every thread we create (and also for the main thread), we allocate a [ThreadContext]
//! structure on the heap, which holds its stack, its thread handle so it will be able to use
//! mutexes, the routine we want it to execute, and the argument to pass to it.
//!
//! ### Thread entry point
//!
//! We tell the kernel the entry of the thread is [`thread_trampoline`].
//! This function will set-up a valid environment for the routine (mainly handle ELF thread local variables),
//! call the routine with its argument, and finally call `svcExitThread` when the routine has returned.
//!
